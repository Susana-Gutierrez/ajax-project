          <h2>Why itâ€™s important to use natural and organic products on your skin</h2>

          <p>
            The use of makeup is really common in women around the world to enhance personal appearance and confidence, but some
            of

            cancer
            and aging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your body absorbs harmful substances when you use non-organic products. So, it is recommended to use natural base
            makeup
            products to avoid ingredients that can promote allergic reactions and irritation. Otherwise this can be very
            dangerous
            and even affect the endocrine system.
          </p>
          <p>

# Go Makeup

A dynamic web app that allows users to search for natural makeup products.

One of my hobbies is Makeup Artistry. I enjoy changing the appearance of people by using makeup and other accessories, and at the same time
is really important to take care of our skin and use quality products to avoid aging, cancer and other sking problems. For this
reason, I decided to create an app for users that love makeup to search for natural products, review their description, ingredients, shades and prices.
Users can also be redirected to an external website to purchase the products.
